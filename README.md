# CMake Tutorial

This is my repository for holding files from the [How to CMake Good](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK6MXr8gasrGmIiSuVQXpfFuE1uPT615s) tutorial.
The commits of the repository should correspond to each of the videos posted by the original author. Full credits to [vector-of-bool](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkYGy96LXk3g-d6kP22aSDA/about) for this great tutorial.

This was was created to complement my learning with ROS, which makes use of CMake to build the executables in the project.

The version of CMake I used for going through this was `cmake version 3.14.2`.
